# Project profile

Form generated from the install survey. Every agent reads it before work to reduce repeated questions.
No secrets. Mark items without evidence as `unchecked`. The user may edit it.

## Tech environment

| Item | Value | Evidence path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language, framework, version | | |
| Package manager, build | | |

## Check commands

| Purpose | Command | Working directory | Side effects (auto-fix, external access, state change) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Test | | | |
| Lint, format | | | |
| Type check | | | |

## Project rule sources

The project's own rule files take priority over this profile and over the workflow defaults. Re-read them from the original path before work; never rely on a copied summary.

| Path | Covers |
| --- | --- |

## Conventions

Pointers to the evidence path, not a copy of the rule files.

| Item | Content | Evidence path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Code style | | |
| Language policy (docs, comments) | | |
| Commit and PR rules | | |

## Forbidden areas

| Path | Reason |
| --- | --- |

## Design system (only when the user has one)

Authoritative for all UI work. Agents follow it without deviation.

| Item | Content | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
